# Sales Insights Project

This repository showcases my skills in data analysis and visualization using Power BI and SQL. Guided by the tutorials from the YouTube channel "Codebasics," I've utilized various techniques such as data extraction, transformation, cleaning, filtering, and dashboard creation to derive meaningful insights from a sales dataset.

## Key Features

- **Data Extraction**: I utilized SQL queries to extract relevant sales data from the dataset provided by the YouTube channel "Codebasics," ensuring accuracy and efficiency in data retrieval.

  
- **Data Transformation and Cleaning**: I performed necessary data transformations and cleaning processes to ensure the data was in a suitable format for analysis. This involved handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and standardizing data formats.

- **Data Filtering**: I applied filters to focus on specific aspects of the sales data, such as time periods, product categories, or geographical regions, allowing for targeted analysis and insights.

- **Dashboard Creation**: Using Power BI, I designed interactive and visually appealing dashboards to present key sales metrics and trends. These dashboards enable stakeholders to explore the data dynamically and gain actionable insights.

## Technologies Used

- Power BI
- SQL

## Dataset Used

The sales dataset used in this project is sourced from Atliq Hardwares, containing detailed information on sales transactions, products, customers, and more.

## Future Improvements

In future iterations of this project, I aim to enhance the dashboard visuals, incorporate advanced analytics techniques, and integrate additional datasets for a more comprehensive analysis of sales performance.
